# UPI Finance Ops Copilot

## Project Vision and Goals
The UPI Finance Ops Copilot is a MERN stack application integrated with Large Language Models (LLMs) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to automate Accounts Receivable (AR) and Accounts Payable (AP) operations for Indian SMEs.

Key functionalities include:
- VPA (Virtual Payment Address) validation to reduce failed payment attempts
- UPI collect request initiation and status tracking via webhook callbacks
- Refund request creation and lifecycle management
- Reconciliation of payment events to invoices with real-time live dashboards
- LLM-powered draft communications grounded in invoice and customer data
- Observability with logging, tracing, and grounding evaluation for trustworthy AI outputs

## Tech Stack Planned
- Frontend: React 18 (with Suspense and streaming Server-Side Rendering)
- Backend: Node.js with Express framework
- Database: MongoDB (Atlas free tier) with Change Streams support for real-time updates
- AI Layer: Large Language Models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) over invoice/customer data
- Deployment: Free-tier services such as Vercel/Netlify for frontend and Render/Railway for backend
- Tools: GitHub for version control and CI/CD, Postman for API testing
